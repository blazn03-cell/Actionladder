## 💰 Revenue Split Details

Based on `server/operatorSubscriptionSplits.ts`:

### Operator Subscription Split Breakdown

**Formula:**
```typescript
{
  potAmount: totalAmount * 0.20,        // 20%
  trusteeAmount: totalAmount * 0.53,    // 53%
  founderAmount: totalAmount * 0.23,    // 23%
  payrollAmount: totalAmount * 0.04,    // 4% (System Operations)
  operatorAmount: 0                     // 0% (Operator receives nothing)
}
```

**Examples:**

| Tier | Monthly Fee | Pot (20%) | Trustee (53%) | Founder (23%) | System (4%) | Operator (0%) |
|------|------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Small | $199 | $39.80 | $105.47 | $45.77 | $7.96 | $0.00 |

**Implementation:**
- Calculated in `server/operatorSubscriptionSplits.ts`

## 📝 Development Workflow

### Available NPM Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server (tsx server/index.ts)
                     # Frontend: http://localhost:5000
                     # Backend: http://localhost:5000/api

# Production
npm run build        # Build both frontend and backend
                     # vite build && esbuild server/index.ts...
npm start            # Run production server (dist/index.js)

# Database
npm run db:push      # Push schema changes to database
                     # Use --force flag if data loss warning

# Type Checking
npm run check        # Run TypeScript compiler check
```

### Development Server Behavior

When you run `npm run dev`:
1. Express server starts on port 5000
2. Vite dev server integrates via middleware
