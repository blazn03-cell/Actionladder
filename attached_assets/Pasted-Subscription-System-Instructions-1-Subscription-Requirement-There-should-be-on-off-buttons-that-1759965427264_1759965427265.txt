Subscription System Instructions

1. Subscription Requirement

* There should be on/off buttons that allow enabling or disabling the subscription whenever needed.
* Each subscription represents a different tier or plan level.
* Operators must have an active subscription to manage or run halls.

---

2. Subscription Split (per hall subscription fee)

* When an Operator pays their subscription, the payment is automatically divided as follows:

  * 20% → Pot and Special Games (used for tournaments, prizes, and incentives)
  * 53% → Trustee (the Trustee who signed up that Operator)
  * 23% → Founder
  * 4% → Payroll (for administrative or system-level operations)

Note: Operators do not keep any portion of their own subscription fee. The subscription is strictly the cost of access to the system.

3. Flow Example (Subscription = $199/month)

* Pot and Games: 20%
* Trustee: 53%
* Founder: 23%
* Payroll: 4%
* Operator: $0 from the subscription

---

4. Trustee Scaling

* Each hall an Operator subscribes to also adds to the total count under their Trustee.
* Example:

  * Operator buys a large tier for $499/month.
  * Trustee receives 53% each month.
  * Founder receives 23% each month.
  * Payroll receives 4%.
  * Pot and Games receive 20%.

5. Subscription Payment Flow
6. Operator pays the subscription fee for a hall.
7. The system automatically splits the payment:

   * Pot: 20%
   * Trustee: 53% (based on the Operator’s assigned Trustee ID)
   * Founder: 23%
   * Payroll: 4%
8. A ledger records each transaction with all amounts stored in cents (integers).

---

6. Purpose and Logic

* Operators pay for the right to operate halls, similar to a SaaS licensing model.
* Trustees have the highest incentive to bring in and manage Operators because they receive the largest share.
* The Founder earns a consistent percentage from every hall system-wide, ensuring long-term sustainability.
* The Pot (20%) is always funded automatically, guaranteeing consistent support for tournaments, special games, and rewards.
* The Payroll (4%) covers operational or administrative expenses.

Summary for Developers

* Each Operator must subscribe separately for every hall they manage.
* Operators keep none of their subscription payment — it is strictly for system access.
* Split per subscription: 20% Pot, 53% Trustee, 23% Founder, 4% Payroll.
* Trustees’ hall counts grow as Operators expand.
* All split transactions should be recorded accurately in the ledger using cents, not floating-point numbers.
* Ensure toggle functionality exists to turn subscriptions on or off as needed.
