Sportsmanship Vote-Out”
1) When it can be used

Live Match Mode: only during a live ladder session (from first break → final ball).

Scope: applies to players and railbirds who are actively participating (signed-in).

Trigger: any operator can open a vote; players/attendees receive a ballot.

2) Who can vote

Eligible voters: signed-in players in that venue + verified attendees (QR check-in) + operators.

Weighting (recommended):

Players: 1x

Verified attendees: 0.5x

Operators: 2x (tie-breaker power)

Anonymity: ballots are anonymous to other users; visible to operators in aggregate only.

3) What “bad attitude” means (make it objective)

Show a one-tap rubric on the ballot:

A. Unsportsmanlike talk (insults, slurs, threats)

B. Disruptive behavior (sharking, banging cues, table interference)

C. Chronic stalling (beyond posted shot clock)

D. Harassment (targeted, repeated)
Voters must pick at least one category and add an optional note (max 140 chars).

4) Safeguards against abuse

Quorum: minimum 12 weighted votes or 30% of checked-in users (whichever is higher).

Threshold: ≥65% “Vote Out” (weighted) to pass.

Cooldown: a user can’t be targeted more than once per night, and no new vote can start within 15 minutes of a failed vote.

Immunity windows: the current shooter is immune until their inning ends (prevents angle-shooting mid-turn).

Appeal: the ejected user can appeal once to operators; operators can convert to a warning by 2/3 operator vote.

5) Consequences (progressive)

1st offense (same month): ejected for the night; -10 ladder points (or 100 credits fine).

2nd: 7-day venue suspension; -25 points.

3rd: 30-day ladder suspension; forfeit all open challenges/side pots (refunded to others).

Operators can override for safety (instant ejection).

6) UX flow (mobile)

Operator taps: “Open Vote-Out” → selects target user.

Banner appears for everyone: “Vote on sportsmanship issue – 90s left.”

Ballot: “Vote Out” / “Keep In” + category tags (A–D) + optional note.

Live tally (hidden to public; operators see %).

Auto-close at 90s (or when quorum reached + 15s grace).

Result card:

Pass → “User is ejected for the night.”

Fail → “Vote failed. Cooldown 15m.”

7) Copy you can paste

Open button: “Start Sportsmanship Vote”

Ballot header: “Does this person’s behavior violate our sportsmanship rules right now?”

Categories: “Unsportsmanlike talk · Disruptive · Stalling · Harassment”

Result (pass): “Vote passed. For tonight, they must leave the floor. Come back respectful, come back welcome.”

Result (fail): “Vote did not pass. Everyone—reset and play on.”

8) Operator rules (quick SOP)

Only open a vote after a direct warning, unless it’s severe (slur/harassment → immediate vote or ejection).

If safety is involved, skip the vote and eject.

Document in the incident log (1–2 sentences).

Endpoints
POST /api/attitude-votes
  body: { targetUserId, sessionId, venueId, endsInSec: 90 }
  auth: operator only
GET  /api/attitude-votes/:id        -- returns remaining time + youVoted?

Close logic
// compute weighted totals
outW = SUM(weight WHERE choice='out');
keepW = SUM(weight WHERE choice='keep');
totalW = outW + keepW;

if (totalW < quorum_required) result = 'fail_quorum';
else if (outW / totalW >= threshold_required) result = 'pass';
else result = 'fail_threshold';

if (result === 'pass') {
  // apply consequence #1
  logIncident(target, 'ejection', 'vote_passed');
  // end their active matches, refund their side-pot locks, update ladder points/credits
}
