Language Rules (Compliance First)

Do not use any gambling, violence, drug, or adult-related words in the app.

Replace unsafe words with safe alternatives as follows:

Bet / Wager / Gamble → Challenge Fee, Match Fee, Ladder Fee

Pot / Side Pot / Pool (money pool) → Prize Pool, Bonus Pool, Season Pool

Buy-in → Entry Fee, Registration Fee

Cash Out / Payout → Rewards, Performance Bonus, Season Rewards

Jackpot / Lottery / Slots / Casino → End-of-Season Prize, Competition Reward

Win Cash / Make Money → Earn Rewards, Unlock Prizes

Stake / Ante → Challenge Credit

Weed / Coke / Pills / Porn / Escort / Guns / Fraud → Never use

“Hustle for cash” → “Hustle for points”

“Bet on yourself” → “Back your skills”

Make sure all text, variables, labels, and UI terms follow these replacements throughout the app.

Revenue Split Logic

Growth Phase (before 20 active halls):

Owner gets 40% of per-hall volume (V)

Partner gets 33% of V

Founder gets 28% of V

Subscriptions are held (not paid yet)

Partner earns about 5% more per hall than Founder during Growth

Expansion Phase (20+ active halls sustained):

Owner gets 40% of V

Partner gets 35% of V plus a small sub bonus (up to $100 per hall)

Founder gets 25% of V plus full subscription flow

Founder earns more than Partner in Expansion stage

Formula:

B = Base fee ($100)

N = Matches per hall (40)

V = B × N = $4,000 per hall

Apply splits based on the above structure

All calculations must be done in cents (integers), not floating point values

Development Notes

All revenue and split calculations must be done in cents (integers).

Percentages should be stored in configuration so they can be edited without changing code.

Founder share is calculated first.

Amateur accounts have partial access to perks (operator-controlled).

Growth Fund is used for promotions, free months, and prize boosts.

Prize Pool (formerly called “Pot”) Example

Example scenario:

20 players

$60 challenge fee

2 matches per month

Step 1: Matches
20 players × 2 ÷ 2 = 20 matches per month

Step 2: Challenge Fees
20 × $60 = $1,200 collected (used for head-to-head rewards, not the Prize Pool)

Step 3: Subscriptions (Tournament percentage)
20 Rookie members × $7.00 = $140
If mixed tiers, use $9.80 for Amateur and $14.00 for Pro

Step 4: Non-member Fees
$12 × 10 matches = $120

Step 5: Extras
Break & Run: $2 × 20 matches = $40
Hill-Hill bonuses: 10 × $10 = $100
Fines (no-show or late): $100
Sponsors: $200

Total Prize Pool = $700

Tracking System for Operators, Trustees, and Founder

Step 1: Player Payment

Product type is Tournament Entry Fee or Challenge Fee.

Payment is collected using Stripe Checkout or PaymentIntent.

Step 2: Tag Payments

Add metadata such as pool_id = "tournament_123".

The database should aggregate totals for each Prize Pool.

Step 3: Hold Funds

Funds remain in the Stripe balance until released manually.

No automatic release.

Step 4: Payout or Split

Use Stripe Connect Transfers to distribute funds as follows:

Winner(s)

Operator cut

Trustees/Admin

Growth Fund

Example for a $200 Prize Pool:

Winner: $120

Operator: $40

Trustees/Admin: $30

Growth Fund: $10

The “pool” is not a Stripe product — it is tracked in the database to show reserved amounts for payout.

Final Reminders

Replace all gambling or inappropriate terms with safe alternatives everywhere.

Handle all revenue logic using cents, not floats.

Subscription and Challenge fees both feed into Prize Pools and splits.

The dashboard should let Operators, Trustees, and Founder track Prize Pools (never called “pot”).
