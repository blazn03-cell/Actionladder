## 1) High‑Risk Issues & Countermeasures (Top 15)

Each item lists **Threat → Prevention (Product/Policy) → Detection → Response SOP → Owner → SLA → KPIs**.

### 1. Player Sandbagging / Cheating

* **Threat:** Players understate skill, dodge tough matches, throw games, or use fake accounts.
* **Prevention (Product):**

  * Enforce **Verified Placement**: FargoRate link or 5 operator‑verified placement matches (streamed or recorded).
  * **Dynamic Tier Engine**: auto‑bump tier on outlier performance (streaks vs higher rated, run‑out %, rack differential, break‑win rate).
  * **Footage Required**: matches must be streamed/recorded or operator‑verified; upload within 24h.
  * **Account Integrity**: 1 phone → 1 account; SMS + email + device fingerprint.
* **Prevention (Policy):**

  * **Play‑Up Rewards** (bonus credits/spotlights) make honest progression more valuable than hiding.
  * **Penalty Ladder:** 1st offense: tier correction + loss of credits; 2nd: 30‑day suspension; 3rd: locked to Pro.
* **Detection:** Suspicion score (see §2): win streak >10 vs higher tiers, break‑and‑run % outlier, sudden rating drops pre‑event, operator flags, peer reports.
* **Response SOP:** Auto‑lock flagged profile → admin review → re‑tier + adjust/void results if mis‑tiered → notify parties → log case.
* **Owner:** Head of Fair Play.
* **SLA:** Initial review within 24h, final within 72h.
* **KPIs:** % flagged, median review time, recidivism <5%.

### 2. No‑Shows / Ducking

* **Threat:** Players accept challenges then ghost; schedule chaos.
* **Prevention:**

  * **Challenge Hold**: pre‑auth or prepaid challenge fee; forfeited on no‑show.
  * **Cancellation Windows**: free reschedule ≥24h; <24h costs a small reschedule fee.
* **Detection:** Calendar + check‑in QR at table; if no scan by T+10 minutes → auto no‑show.
* **Response SOP:** Auto‑payout to opponent; 2 no‑shows in 30 days → 30‑day suspension.
* **Owner:** Match Ops.
* **SLA:** Auto decision at T+10; suspension at 2nd event.
* **KPIs:** No‑show rate <4%.

### 3. Stripe Account Freeze (Language/Use‑Case)

* **Threat:** Payments flagged as “gambling.”
* **Prevention:**

  * **Language Library** (see §5): use *challenge fee, ladder dues, prize distribution*; never *bet, wager, sportsbook*.
  * **Productized Flows:** membership + challenge fees + prize distributions. Keep any side action **off‑platform**.
  * **Clear Descriptor:** “Action Ladder – Competitive Pool League.”
* **Detection:** Monitor Stripe alerts + dispute spikes.
* **Response SOP:** Pause new challenges → switch to membership‑only mode (no prize distributions) → appeal with documentation (rules, streams, operator contracts).
* **Owner:** Payments Lead.
* **SLA:** Freeze response pack within 4 hours.
* **KPIs:** 0 compliance warnings; 0 account freezes.

### 4. Chargebacks & Disputes

* **Threat:** Players dispute fees.
* **Prevention:** Signed ToS, on‑screen acceptance, match audit trails (check‑in QR, scorecard, footage), receipts with metadata.
* **Detection:** Stripe webhook on `charge.dispute.created`.
* **Response SOP:** Pull evidence bundle (match ID, venue, time, footage link, QR check‑in, ToS acceptance) → submit within 48h.
* **Owner:** Payments Ops.
* **SLA:** Evidence submitted within 24–48h.
* **KPIs:** Win‑rate >70%, disputes <0.5% of charges.

### 5. Operator Pushback

* **Threat:** Halls think it adds overhead or steals action.
* **Prevention:** Revenue share (5–10%), beer/food tie‑ins, white‑label option (hall branding “Powered by Action Ladder”).
* **Detection:** Operator NPS, opt‑out reasons tracked.
* **Response SOP:** Operator success call → tailor promos → on‑site launch night with stream + posters.
* **Owner:** Operator Success.
* **SLA:** Outreach <24h post‑complaint.
* **KPIs:** Operator NPS ≥50, monthly churn <3%.

### 6. Scaling Costs / Cash Burn

* **Threat:** Server, streaming, payouts burn cash pre‑profit.
* **Prevention:** Single‑market MVP (50–100 players), lean stack, community content. Focus on positive unit economics per hall.
* **Detection:** CAC\:LTV, contribution margin per hall.
* **Response SOP:** Freeze non‑core features; scale geographic expansion only when CM>0.
* **Owner:** CEO/Finance.
* **SLA:** Monthly finance review.
* **KPIs:** Payback <3 months.

* **SLA:** Correction within 2 business days.
* **KPIs:** 0 unrecoverable mis‑routes.

* **Threat:** Stolen cards, multi‑accounting, collusion.
* **Prevention:** 3DS where available, velocity checks, device fingerprint, selfie/ID (high‑value tiers), operator vouch.
* **Detection:** Fraud score, mismatched geos, payment AVS/CVV fails.
* **Response SOP:** Lock → KYC → refund legitimate cardholders → ban bad actors.
* **Owner:** Trust & Safety.
* **SLA:** 24h.
* **KPIs:** Fraud loss <0.15% GMV.

* **Owner:** Fair Play.
* **SLA:** 72h.
* **KPIs:** <1% result reversals.
