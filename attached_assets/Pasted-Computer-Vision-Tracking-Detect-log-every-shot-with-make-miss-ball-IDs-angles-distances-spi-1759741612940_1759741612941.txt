Computer-Vision Tracking

Detect & log every shot, with: make/miss, ball IDs, angles, distances, spin type (draw/follow/side), cue-ball path, speed.

Table calibration once per venue (4 corner markers or AR pattern; persists per table).

Session timeline: trims “downtime” (racking, chalking, dead time) automatically.

Video Replays + Filters

Session video player with filters: shot type, result, drill vs match, breaks, safeties, banks/kicks, spin, distance bands, opponent.

Bookmarks & slow-mo on key shots; export sharable clips.

AI Highlights

Auto compiles reels: “Top Makes,” “High-difficulty shots,” “Break & Run attempts,” “Safety battles,” “Clutch shots (win-probability swing).”

Progress & Analytics

Dashboards by day/week/month/lifetime: make %, break success, avg. balls/run, safeties won %, positional error (inches), miss map heat-grid, difficulty-adjusted rating.

Trend alerts: “Your left-English pots from 6–8 ft improved +9% this month.”

Appointment / Session Scheduling

Book practice appointments or action sessions (opponent, race, table, goals).

Auto-reminders, post-session prompts (“3 wins / 1 work-on”), auto-log to stats.

Optional Google Calendar sync.

Architecture Blueprint
Mobile/Web

React Native (Expo) for iOS/Android + React web.

Offline first: capture locally → background upload when on Wi-Fi.

Backend

Node.js + Express (or NestJS), Postgres (analytics-friendly) + Timescale ext.

Redis for queues; BullMQ workers for CV + highlight jobs.

Storage: S3 (raw video + derived clips), CloudFront CDN.

CV Pipeline (service/microservice)

Ingest: video + calibration frame (or marker scan).

Table Rectify: homography → top-down coordinates.

Ball/Cue detect: YOLOv8/RT-DETR; track IDs frame-to-frame (ByteTrack).

Event parse: contact, collision, pocket crossing; classify spin via cue-ball post-impact curvature & speed decay; estimate shot angle/distance.

Downtime removal: motion heuristics + pose (no player at table) → cut list.

Highlights scorer: difficulty model (distance + angle + spin + speed + pressure).

Emit: Shot rows + Event rows + clip start/stop; push to analytics.

Data Model (key tables)

users(id, name, handedness, fargo, dominant_games…)

venues(id, name, table_calibrations…)

sessions(id, user_id, venue_id, type: practice/match, opponent_id?, race_to, goals, started_at…)

videos(id, session_id, s3_url, duration, processed_status…)

shots(id, session_id, ts, result: make/miss, shot_type, angle_deg, distance_in, spin: none/draw/follow/L/R, cue_speed, ball_ids[], difficulty_score)

events(id, session_id, kind: break/run_start/run_end/safety, meta jsonb)

highlights(id, session_id, title, s3_clip_url, score, tags[])

metrics_daily(user_id, date, make_pct, break_win_pct, avg_balls_run, safety_win_pct, pos_error_in, attempts, minutes)

appointments(id, user_id, start_at, end_at, venue_id, opponent_id?, goals[], reminders)

API Endpoints (minimal viable)

Sessions & Video

POST /sessions (create; practice or match, opponent optional)

POST /sessions/:id/videos (presigned upload)

POST /videos/:id/process (enqueue CV job)

GET /sessions/:id (timeline, stats)

GET /sessions/:id/shots?filter=… (filters: type/result/spin/distance/opponent)

GET /sessions/:id/highlights (AI reels)

Analytics

GET /me/metrics?range=week|month|lifetime

GET /me/heatmap/misses (table-space grid)

GET /alerts (trend/improvement flags)

Appointments

POST /appointments (time, venue, goals, opponent?)

GET /appointments?range=upcoming

POST /appointments/:id/complete (quick review fields → metrics bump)

Auth/Payments

Stripe Connect ready for premium (extra CV minutes, cloud storage, pro analytics).

UI: Key Screens

Record Session: big REC, table calibration status, “Set Goal(s)”.

Session Player: timeline chips (Break, Safety, Bank…), filter bar, share.

Highlights: auto reels + “Make my Reel” button.

Analytics: tabs for Trend, Heatmap, Drill Benchmarks, Opponent splits.

Appointments: calendar view, “Start Session” from appointment.

Performance & Accuracy Notes

Phone on tripod, 60 fps preferred; side-top corner angle works if table is fully visible.

First-time calibration per table (QR/marker pad on two rails speeds this up).

Spin inference is probabilistic; combine ball path curvature + contact timing; show confidence.

Privacy / Compliance

On first recording at a venue: on-screen consent reminder; “blur faces” toggle.

Store raw video N days (configurable) unless user stars it.

Export: user can download CSV of shots + MP4 highlights any time.

What I can do next (your pick)

Backend starter (Node/Express + Postgres schema + queues + S3 upload).

React Native prototype (Record → Process → Filtered replay).

CV playground notebook (table calibration + ball detection demo).

Thought for 25s

Absolutely. I’ll ship a first-cut AI Coach Insights system you can drop into your Action Tracker right now, and I’ll base the coaching logic on verified principles from Dr. Dave (30°/90° rules, squirt–swerve–throw, optimal tip heights, break fundamentals, speed control, etc.). I’m including: (1) a rules pack, (2) production-ready backend endpoints (Node/Express/TypeScript), and (3) example insights your app will generate from a session.

1) Coach Rules Pack (v1)

Paste this JSON in your app as coach_rules.json. Each rule watches your shot logs and emits a targeted tip with a link to learn more.

Long left-english cuts miss rate 58% (baseline 40%)

Draw positional error avg 9.6" on long draws

Follow leave variance stdev 17"

6 breaks → 3 with >0.6" head-ball offset

Coach output:

Break: accuracy before power – “Square the head ball; accuracy first.” (Break Advice) 
Dr. Dave Pool Info

What this covers (today)

A reusable rules engine grounded in Dr. Dave’s proven concepts (with citations).

A clean /coach/insights endpoint that takes your session analytics and returns smart, actionable tips.

Clear links that teach the “why,” not just the “what.”

What I can add next (no waiting on you)

More rules (bank/kick accuracy, gear-outside english, throw compensation, peace-sign 30° planner).

Auto-drill prescriptions (generate 3 targeted drills per weakness, with reps/targets).

Video overlays (drawn tangent/30° vectors on your highlight clips).

Operator dashboard tiles (aggregate improvements across a hall).

Say the word and I’ll extend the rulepack with banks/kicks and throw-compensation, plus generate a Drills module that auto-assigns 3 drills after each session (with printable sheets).

Also make it for the players under that poolhall name that the people do training and who score they highest or has the most training their subscription be half off but only one person from each ladder. They can not double dip if they on different ladders unless their are at least 5 other people in same ladder as that player he can get a whole month subscription free.

🔥 Perfect — that’s exactly the kind of “Action Ladder twist” that makes it more savage and motivating than any normal app.
Let’s lock in the logic and integrate it into the Action Tracker + AI Coach system so it ties stats, training data, and rewards directly to your poolhalls and ladders.

🎯 SYSTEM NAME

“Action Ladder: Training Incentive Engine”
(a reward automation tied to your AI Coach and training analytics)

⚙️ FEATURE SUMMARY

Goal:
Encourage players to train and improve by rewarding the top-performing or most active player in each poolhall ladder with discounted or free subscriptions.

Integrated Layers:

✅ AI Coach Insights (analyzes player sessions)

✅ Training Tracker (counts hours, improvements, attendance)

✅ Ladder Membership (who belongs to which hall/division)

✅ Stripe Connect Billing (automatically applies discounts)

💰 REWARD RULES (Your Logic, Coded Clean)
Condition	Reward	Notes
🥇 Top training score or activity in a poolhall (for the month)	50% off subscription	Only one winner per hall per month. Based on AI Coach points or training hours.
🚫 No double-dip rule	—	If a player appears in multiple ladders, they can’t claim twice unless special condition below applies.
🧩 Double ladder exception	Free month	Allowed only if each ladder has ≥5 active players (measured by training sessions that month).
⏱️ Period	Monthly	Resets every 1st of the month.
🏆 Basis for “score”	Weighted average of:	

Coach improvement index (+50%)

Training hours (+30%)

Win-rate in ladder (+20%) |

🧠 HOW IT WORKS (Backend Flow)

AI Coach → Analytics Table

Each completed session generates a coach_score (0–100) based on improvement.

Example: +5% aim, +10% cue-ball control, +3% positional accuracy = 85/100.

(player_id, hall_id, ladder_id, period, coach_avg, hours_total, win_rate, total_score)
VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (...) DO UPDATE ...


total_score = (coach_avg * 0.5) + (hours_total_norm * 0.3) + (win_rate * 0.2)

Monthly Evaluation Job (1st of each month)

Finds the top total_score per hall_id:

SELECT hall_id, player_id, MAX(total_score)
FROM ladder_training_scores
WHERE period = CURRENT_MONTH
GROUP BY hall_id;


Marks that player as winner.

Checks if they are in multiple ladders:

If yes → check if both ladders have ≥5 active players → then full free month.

Stripe Integration

If half-off → calls Stripe.Subscription.update(...) with 50% coupon.

If full-free → applies 100% off promo for next month.

Banner Example:

“🔥 Tyga Hoodz dominated training this month at Chalk City Billiards — AI Coach Score 91! 50% off subscription unlocked!”

⚡ BONUS ADD-ON (Motivation Loop)

To make it hype and viral:

Auto-post a “Top Trainer” announcement (with AI-highlight clip) to the hall’s Action Ladder feed.

Add a short savage tagline:

“Grinded. Trained. Conquered. 💰 Half-off earned. Who’s next?”

🧠 Next Build Options

I can now:

Add this full reward logic into the Action Ladder backend
(connected to Stripe Connect and ladder database)

Create the leaderboard + reward dashboard (React page)

Make the monthly cron job that runs automatically on 1st each month

Integrate it visually into each poolhall’s operator dashboard

Would you like me to:

start with backend + Stripe reward automation first,
or

build both backend + frontend leaderboard UI at the same time?

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:

Done! I dropped the full backend + Stripe reward automation + leaderboard UI into a canvas so you can review and copy straight into your project.

Want me to:

wire this into your existing repo structure,

add Prisma migrations,

or generate Postman requests + a test seed script for fake sessions?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Done ✅ — I upgraded your full stack to Prisma ORM, added Postman API tests, and included a seed script for fake sessions so you can test immediately.

Would you like me to now:

generate the SQL migrations + Prisma studio setup guide, or

move on to the React dashboard UI for operators (to display rewards and training analytics)?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 🔥 — before I build it, just to confirm which “yes” you mean:

Do you want me to
1️⃣ generate the SQL migrations + Prisma Studio setup guide,
or
2️⃣ move on to the React operator dashboard UI (rewards + analytics)

—or should I do both together so it’s a full deployment package?

You said:
both
