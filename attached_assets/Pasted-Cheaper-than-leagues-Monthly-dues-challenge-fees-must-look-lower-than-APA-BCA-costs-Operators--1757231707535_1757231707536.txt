Cheaper than leagues → Monthly dues + challenge fees must look lower than APA/BCA costs.

Operators win → They see more walk-ins and they get a predictable cut.

You & Trustees win → Margins are baked into fees, upgrades, and scaling, not hidden.

No Suspicion → Every dollar has a “reason” that sounds normal (platform fee, upgrade, or perk).

💵 Smart Revenue Layers
1. Challenge Fee Commission

Take 5–10% cut from every challenge fee.

Pitch as “League admin fee” (normal for any organized competition).

Round up every fee to the nearest $1 → sneaky compounding profit over time.

👉 Example: $100 challenge → $90 pot + $10 platform fee.
Split:

$5 Action Ladder (you/trustees)

$3 operator

$2 prize fund (optional league bonus pot — feels generous, but you control it).

2. Membership Tiers

Rookie $20/month → training credits, access to matches.

Basic $25/month → small commission, tournament eligibility.

Pro $60/month → free tourneys, lower commission, prestige.

Operator free add-ons for rookies → keeps signups flowing.

💡 Margins come from most rookies staying rookies + pros paying for “savings” they don’t always use.

3. Operator Subscription

$199/month baseline.

Add-ons: Analytics (+$50), White-label (+$75), Tournament module (+$75).

Bundle discount so it feels cheaper if they take all.

Operators never feel squeezed because they can “choose” upgrades.

4. Extras Players Will Pay For

Custom walk-in songs ($5–10).

Highlight reel hosting ($10/month).

“Dog of the Day” or “Player Spotlight” promotion ($5–15).

Team captain dashboard ($15/month).

These are optional → no one calls it unfair, but people buy them for hype.

5. Breakage

If you use “Ladder Points” or credits:

Some players forget or don’t redeem them.

That leftover is pure profit, and looks legit on paper.

🧮 Sample Payout Flow (Fair & Unsuspicious)
$100 Challenge (2 Players)

$90 pot

$10 fee

$5 Action Ladder (you + trustees)

$3 Operator

$2 “League prize fund”

Winner gets $90 — clean.
Operator sees $3 — feels rewarded.
You + trustee skim $5 — built-in, not suspicious.

Scale Example

100 matches/month → $500 margin just on $100 matches.

Add memberships, operator subs, upgrades → easily $5K+ profit monthly without looking shady.

⚡ The magic phrase you’ll use everywhere:
“Cheaper than leagues, pays operators more, keeps payouts transparent.”
No one questions it if they feel they’re saving vs APA/BCA.
