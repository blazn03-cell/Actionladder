We’ll assume minimum 2 matches per player per month. Players Match Level Matches/Month (2 each) Season Pot (4 mo) Operator 50% Trustee 50% 15 players @ $60 30 matches/month ≈$7,200 total ≈$7,200 ≈$3,600 ≈$3,600 30 players @ $100 60 matches/month ≈$24,000 total ≈$24,000 ≈$12,000 ≈$12,000 50 players mixed ($60/$100/$1,000) 100+ matches/month ≈$34,000 total* ≈$34,000 ≈$17,000 ≈$17,000 *This example mix assumes per month: 60×$60 matches + 39×$100 matches + one $1,000 marquee match. Operator Takeaways 15 players @ $60 = $3,600 in operator revenue in 4 months. 30 players @ $100 = $12,000 in operator revenue in 4 months. 50 players mixed = $17,000 in operator revenue in 4 months, plus high-stakes nights to drive food/drink sales. Trustee Takeaways Same as operator: 50% share funds ladder operations, bonus pools, streaming/marketing, and big end-of-season payouts for players. 🔥 SPECIAL BONUSES + END-OF-SEASON EVENTS King of the Hill Streak Bonuses — cash rewards for multiple wins in a row. Hill-Hill Chaos — high-pressure tiebreaker matches with cash bounties. End-of-Season Tournaments — top ranked players compete for a prize pot made up of challenge fees + sponsorships. Special Events — one-off big matches, sponsor nights, streamed exhibition matches. Players know there’s always a chance at extra cash; operators know there’s always a marquee event driving traffic. The Core Money Flow A Working Example 30 players @ $100 matches: 60 matches/month × 4 months = $24,000 total challenge fees. Before splitting 50/50, skim 5% to bonus pool = $1,200. Remaining $22,800 split 50/50: Operator $11,400 Trustee $11,400 Bonus pool $1,200 funds streak bonuses + end-of-season tournament. Even with a small skim, the Operator and Trustee still keep nearly their full 50/50 cut, and players get meaningful bonus cash.Every match has a challenge fee or action fee attached. make this so i can send it in a pdf and a message on the messenger That gross fee can be divided into three buckets: Operator Share (50%) – goes directly to the hall for table time, staffing, bar/food upsell incentive. Trustee Share (50%) – funds Action Ladder operations, marketing, and player bonuses/tournament pots. (Optional) A very small portion of each fee stays in a “bonus pool” (automatically earmarked before the 50/50 split) to fund streak bonuses and end-of-season tournaments. Example of that small skim: $60 match = $3–$5 automatically into a bonus pool. $100 match = $5–$10 automatically into a bonus pool. $1,000 match = $25–$50 automatically into a bonus pool. That’s only 5–10% skimmed from each fee, but over dozens or hundreds of matches it builds a big bonus pot.
