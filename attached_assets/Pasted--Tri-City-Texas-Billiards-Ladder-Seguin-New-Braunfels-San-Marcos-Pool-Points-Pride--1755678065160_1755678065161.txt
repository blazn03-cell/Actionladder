🎱 Tri-City Texas Billiards Ladder 🎱

Seguin • New Braunfels • San Marcos

💵 Pool. Points. Pride. Welcome to the Tri-City Ladder — where money = points, walk-ins got theme songs, matches get streamed, and if you dog a ball… best believe we’re clipping it. 😂

🔥 How It Works

Games: Straight 8 • BCA • Fast 8 • 14.1 • Saratoga • 9-Ball • 10-Ball • 1-Pocket (9ft only)

Bets: $50 min • $300 max (enough to sting, not enough to bankrupt)

Money = Points (Ex: $100 = 100 points)

Commission: 15% non-members (10% house / 5% ops) • 5% members

📊 The Ladder

Two lists: 600+ killers / 599 & below grinders

Challenge same rung or one above

Winner climbs, loser drops like a bad stock pick 📉

🚫 No-Shows (Deadbeat Rule)

Don’t show up? You just bought an L

$30 penalty + commission still owed

Opponent gets the points

You slide straight to the bottom

2 no-shows in 90 days = suspension (bye Felicia 👋)

🤝 Sportsmanship

Civil trash talk? ✅ Absolutely. (Keep it clever, keep it funny — make it entertaining, not violent.)

Fighting? ❌ Not WWE.

Pay when you lose — don’t be that guy.

Respect the felt. Respect the ladder. Respect the hustle.
